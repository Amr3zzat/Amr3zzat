### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer with more than 3 years of solid experience in backend development.
I have experience in building PHP websites and Restful APIs using PHP based frameworks, Laravel and Symfony, beside my verifiable experience in e-commerce solutions and frameworks, Opencart/Sylius /Woocommerce.
My main core is to implement clean code and architecture for sites for easily updating, maintaining and scaling them in a secure and effective way.
